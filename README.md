# stock-portfolio-analyzer
I'm sick of schwab, google/yahoo finance, and other portfolio analyzers. They suck. I'm building a portfolio analyzer that has:
- The simple visuals of google finance
- Ability to add cash positions (crazy that google/yahoo/seekingalpha doesnt have this!)
- Quant anaysis to see the risk adjusted performance of your portfolio and tips on how to optimize your holdings given the news/macroeconomic data at the time
- See real time prices even in after hours and pre-market (most portfolio viewers don't have this they only show closing price)
- Insider trades, news, float, instittiounal vs retail holdings, polititan trades, analyst ratings and consumer reports

Thank you ChatGPT for the roadmap
